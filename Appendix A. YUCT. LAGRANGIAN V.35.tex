				\end{center}
				\large\textbf This technical appendix provides a practical, implementation-oriented specification of the Yakushev Unified Coordination Theory (YUCT) V35.0 for cross-domain modeling, forecasting, and verification. YUCT V35.0 is organized as a 120-sector modular system coupled by an explicit intersector network of 7140 coefficients $\{\kappa_{sr}\}$ ($0\le s<r\le 119$). The central operational principle is YPSDC (Yakushev Protocol for Synchronous Distributed Coordination), which separates (i) \emph{offline} distribution of structured priors (dictionaries, protocols, constraint sets) from (ii) \emph{online} activation by short indices. Coordination efficiency is quantified by $\Keff$ as the ratio of a baseline (na\"ive) coordination cost to the achieved cost under dictionary-index activation. Importantly, this protocol-level acceleration does not require superluminal signaling: only indices are transmitted physically, preserving microcausality ($v\le c$).
				
				At the mathematical level, this appendix presents the full YUCT V35.0 Lagrangian as a sector-structured functional on a 19-dimensional differentiable manifold with a coordination field $\Psi_{MN}$, sector fields $\{\Phi_s\}$, auxiliary observer fields $\phi_{1,2}$, and constraint operators enforcing admissibility and consistency. The Lagrangian is intended as a \emph{computable interface}: each sector is a modeling slot populated by validated domain models (e.g., GR/post-Newtonian gravity; climate circulation; demographic dynamics), and the coupling matrix $\kappa$ encodes cross-sector influence channels to enable cascade prediction. The guiding modeling assumption is that significant events in one sector propagate through the $\kappa$-network to produce measurable secondary effects in linked sectors, with uncertainty that can be quantified and reduced by calibration.
				
				To ensure scientific tractability despite the network size, YUCT adopts \emph{system-level verification}: instead of testing all 7140 links in isolation, the model is evaluated by reproducible predictive performance on complex events and by cross-sector consistency against constraint sets. This appendix provides a step-by-step protocol: initializing the system; loading sector definitions and baseline couplings; selecting primary sectors; activating first-order links; performing cascade simulation; producing probabilistic predictions; and iteratively calibrating $\kappa$ from historical data, expert elicitation, and machine learning under regularization.
				
				In addition, this appendix includes a YUCT formalism for \emph{false dictionaries} (pseudosciences, erroneous theories, and non-falsifiable knowledge systems). A falsity score $L(D)\in[0,1]$ is defined and decomposed into internal consistency, $\kappa$-weighted cross-sector constraint satisfaction, experimental verifiability, and evolutionary stability components. Practical marking is provided: each dictionary is assigned a numeric grade $L(D)$, a discrete label (\texttt{FD-I}, \texttt{FD-II}, \texttt{FD-III}, \texttt{FD-OK}), and an auditable diagnostic vector of component scores. Finally, this appendix defines measurable progress metrics (time-to-correction, retraction rate, replication success) and proposes an A/B experimental design comparing two matched research programs to test whether early false-dictionary screening improves research throughput and reproducibility without suppressing genuine novelty.

	\paragraph{Interpretation of sectors.}
	A ``sector'' in YUCT V35.0 is a modeling slot (module) that can be populated by validated domain equations, datasets, and observables. Not all sectors are intended as fundamental microscopic fields; many are effective/macroscopic modules. Intersector couplings $\kappa_{sr}$ define a weighted influence graph used for cascade prediction, cross-sector verification, and falsifiability checks.

	% A.1 INTRODUCTION AND PHILOSOPHY
	% ============================================================
	\section*{A.1. Introduction and Philosophy of the Approach}
	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{A.1. Introduction and Philosophy of the Approach}
	
	YUCT V35.0 is not presented solely as a mathematical formalization, but as an operational tool for:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item modeling complex interdisciplinary systems,
		\item predicting cross-sector effects,
		\item coordinating knowledge across scientific disciplines,
		\item forecasting cascade impacts of complex events.
	\end{itemize}
	\paragraph{Scope and epistemic status.}
	This appendix describes YUCT V35.0 as a technical modeling framework. Statements in this document should be interpreted according to their role:
	(i) \emph{definitions} (formal objects, metrics, protocols);
	(ii) \emph{model assumptions} (sector decompositions, coupling priors, cascade depth);
	(iii) \emph{empirical claims} (only when supported by reproducible datasets and explicit uncertainty budgets).
	The framework is intended to be evaluated by falsifiable prediction quality and cross-sector constraint satisfaction, not by rhetorical coherence.
	
	\paragraph{Why cross-sector modeling is scientifically motivated.}
	Many high-impact phenomena (pandemics, systemic financial stress, technology transitions, large-scale disasters) are multi-domain by construction: causal influences traverse biological, infrastructural, economic, and political layers. YUCT treats these layers as coupled modules and makes the coupling structure explicit via $\kappa_{sr}$, enabling (a) transparent hypothesis tracking, (b) controlled ablations of coupling pathways, and (c) reproducible calibration and benchmarking.
	
	\paragraph{Limitations (explicit).}
	The approach is limited by: sector model validity, data availability, identifiability of couplings, and governance constraints. High-dimensional coupling networks require regularization, cross-validation, and uncertainty reporting; without these, any apparent fit can be spurious. This appendix therefore emphasizes auditable constraint sets $P_r$, held-out evaluation, and program-level progress metrics.
	
	\paragraph{Core operational principle (cascade through couplings).}
	A significant event in one sector induces a cascade through the $\kappa$-coupling graph:
	\[
	\text{event in sector }s \ \Rightarrow\ \text{activation of links }\{\kappa_{sr}\}\ \Rightarrow\ \text{secondary/tertiary effects in linked sectors }r.
	\]
	This appendix describes how to instantiate this idea as a reproducible pipeline.
	\paragraph{What enables discovery in this work.}
	This appendix enables an operational route to scientific discovery by making cross-domain hypotheses explicit and testable: (i) sector models and their observables are declared; (ii) cross-sector influence channels are represented by an explicit coupling graph $\{\kappa_{sr}\}$; (iii) falsification is implemented via auditable constraint sets $P_r$ and out-of-sample evaluation; and (iv) incoherent or non-falsifiable theory dictionaries can be screened using the false-dictionary module.
	As a practical operating objective, implementations of the pipeline may target a baseline discovery/forecasting accuracy on the order of $0.85\pm0.05$ for selected benchmark tasks, with the understanding that this figure is a performance goal that must be demonstrated by retrospective benchmarks and held-out validation rather than assumed a priori.

	These diagrams formalize the protocol-level separation between (i) offline distribution of a shared dictionary and (ii) causal online transmission of a short index. They are included to clarify that apparent ``instantaneous'' coordination does not imply superluminal signaling.

	\subsection*{A.8.0. Implementation checklist}
	A minimal reproducible implementation should define the following artifacts:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
		\item \textbf{Sector registry:} a machine-readable list of the 120 sectors, including: name, observables, datasets, model entry points, and constraint set identifiers.
		\item \textbf{$\kappa$-matrix:} baseline coupling matrix $\kappa_{sr}$ with declared provenance and versioning.
		\item \textbf{Constraint sets:} auditable sector constraint sets $P_r$ (laws/benchmarks) with executable evaluation procedures.
		\item \textbf{Event schema:} a standard JSON schema for events $E$ (primary sector, parameters, time window, location).
		\item \textbf{Calibration protocol:} regularized fitting procedure with cross-validation and held-out test.
		\item \textbf{Reporting template:} standardized output format containing predictions, uncertainty, causal paths, and constraint satisfaction.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection*{A.8.1. Operational pipeline}
	For an input event $E$ in primary sector $s$:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
		\item \textbf{Ingest:} validate event schema and map to sector $s$.
		\item \textbf{First-order activation:} select linked sectors $r$ by top-$k$ weights $|\kappa_{sr}|$ (or $|\kappa_{sr}|q_r$).
		\item \textbf{Cascade:} propagate to depth $d$ with thresholding on effective weight.
		\item \textbf{Prediction:} compute sector-specific outputs with uncertainty and time windows.
		\item \textbf{Verification:} evaluate predictions and constraint satisfaction; update $\kappa$ under regularization.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection*{A.8.2. Recommended regularization and identifiability checks}
	Because 7140 couplings are typically not identifiable from limited data, practical implementations should use:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item sparsity priors (L1 / elastic net),
		\item hierarchical priors by sector group,
		\item ablation tests (remove subnetworks and measure performance drop),
		\item sensitivity analysis (parameter perturbations vs output stability).

		\item Sector 62 (ecology): observables $O_{62}$ include migration timing, biomass proxies.
		\item Sector 86 (demography): observables $O_{86}$ include migration flows, age-structure changes.
	\end{itemize}
	A minimal cascade model uses:
	$$
	\Delta O_{62}\approx f_{24\to62}(\kappa_{24,62},O_{24}),\qquad
	\Delta O_{86}\approx f_{62\to86}(\kappa_{62,86},O_{62}),
	$$
	where $f$ are calibrated response maps. Falsifiers are out-of-sample prediction errors against held-out migration datasets.
	
	\paragraph{Example 2: networks $\rightarrow$ trade $\rightarrow$ healthcare resilience.}
	Use:
	$$
	\Delta O_{72}\approx f_{100\to72}(\kappa_{100,72},O_{100}),\qquad
	\Delta O_{89}\approx f_{72\to89}(\kappa_{72,89},O_{72}),
	$$
	with $O_{100}$ (network connectivity/latency), $O_{72}$ (supply-chain disruption indices), $O_{89}$ (ICU load / service backlog). The Lagrangian term provides a place to encode these mappings via $\Psi_{sr}$ and $O_s$.
	
	\paragraph{Implementation note.}
	In practice, $f_{s\to r}$ should be implemented as a constrained, regularized model class (e.g.\ generalized linear model, state-space model, or a neural surrogate) with explicit constraints $P_r$ and cross-validation.

	\section*{A.FD. Theory of False Dictionaries (YUCT formalism)}
	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{A.FD. Theory of False Dictionaries (YUCT formalism)}
	
	\subsection*{A.FD.1. Definition}
	A candidate theory in sector $s$ is represented as a dictionary
	\[
	D_s=\{\kappa_i\mapsto \mathcal{A}_i\},
	\]
	where a compact code activates a claim/prediction/action. A false dictionary is one that systematically fails reproducible tests and/or violates high-weight cross-sector constraints.
	
	\subsection*{A.FD.2. Falsity metric and marking scheme}
	Define:
	\[
	L(D_s)=1-F(D_s),\qquad
	F(D_s)=\alpha F_{\mathrm{int}}+\beta F_{\mathrm{xs}}+\gamma F_{\mathrm{exp}}+\delta F_{\mathrm{evo}},
	\]
	with default weights
	\[
	(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)=(0.30,\,0.25,\,0.25,\,0.20),
	\]
	to be calibrated on retrospective corpora.
	
	\paragraph{Cross-sector compatibility via auditable constraint sets.}
	For each sector $r$, define a constraint set $P_r$ (auditable laws/benchmarks). Define:
	\[
	C(D_s,D_r)=1-\frac{1}{|P_r|}\sum_{p\in P_r}\indicator\{D_s\text{ violates }p\}\in[0,1].
	\]
	Define sector authority weights $q_r>0$ and link weights:
	\[
	w_{sr}=\abs{\kappa_{sr}}\,q_r,\qquad
	F_{\mathrm{xs}}(D_s)=\frac{1}{\sum_r w_{sr}}\sum_{r}w_{sr}C(D_s,D_r).
	\]
	
	\paragraph{Predictive coordination measure (clarification of $K_{\mathrm{eff}}$ role).}
	In this module, coordination efficiency is used only as an operational predictive measure:
	\[
	\Kpred(D)=\frac{N_{\mathrm{correct,OOS}}(D)}{\max(1,\mathrm{Comp}(D))},
	\]
	and does not substitute empirical and cross-sector checks.
	
	\paragraph{Marking labels.}
	Assign:
	\[
	\texttt{FD-I}: L>0.7,\quad
	\texttt{FD-II}: 0.5<L\le0.7,\quad
	\texttt{FD-III}: 0.3<L\le0.5,\quad
	\texttt{FD-OK}: L\le0.3,
	\]
	with diagnostic vector $(F_{\mathrm{int}},F_{\mathrm{xs}},F_{\mathrm{exp}},F_{\mathrm{evo}},\Kpred)$.
	
	\subsection*{A.FD.3. Progress metrics and an A/B experiment}
	Define program-level metrics:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item time-to-correction (TTC),
		\item retraction rate (RR),
		\item replication success (RS).
	\end{itemize}
	Compare two matched research programs: (A) with false-dictionary screening and cross-sector constraint reporting, (B) baseline practice, and evaluate whether TTC decreases and RS increases without suppressing genuine novelty (operationalized by field-specific success outcomes).

	\subsection*{A.L.1. Field content and indices (19D)}
	YUCT V35.0 uses a 19-dimensional manifold with indices
	\[
	M,N,P,Q=0,1,\dots,18.
	\]
	A representative partition (used for organizational purposes) may be written as:
	\begin{align*}
		\mu,\nu &= 0,1,2,3 &&\text{(4D spacetime carrier indices)},\\
		a,b &= 4,\dots,8 &&\text{(additional spatial/organizational coordinates, model-dependent)},\\

		i,j &= 12,\dots,17 &&\text{(information/organizational coordinates, model-dependent)},\\
		\Xi &= 18 &&\text{(meta-level coordinate, model-dependent)}.
	\end{align*}
	Core fields used in the V35.0 Lagrangian include:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item $\Psi_{MN}$: coordination field on the 19D manifold,
		\item $\Phi_s$: sector fields ($s=0,\dots,119$),
		\item $\phi_1,\phi_2$: observer fields (coordination boundary/interaction anchors),
		\item $\Dprior$: prior dictionary/protocol structure used by YPSDC modules,
		\item $\kappa_{sr}$: explicit intersector coupling coefficients (7140 links for $s<r$).

	\subsection*{A.L.2.D. Decomposition into sub-Lagrangians (explicit component forms)}
	\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A.L.2.D. Decomposition into sub-Lagrangians}
	
	This subsection records explicit component forms used throughout the V35.0 specification. These expressions are to be interpreted as an \emph{EFT-style modular specification}: sector-dependent terms and coefficients must be calibrated and validated against declared datasets and constraints.
	
	\paragraph{Coordination-field sector $L_{\Psi}$.}
	A representative (EFT-style) form is:
	\begin{align}
		L_{\Psi} &=
		-\frac{1}{4}F_{MN}(\Psi)F^{MN}(\Psi)
		-\frac{1}{2}m_{\Psi}^2\Psi_{MN}\Psi^{MN}
		-\lambda_{\Psi^4}\big(\Psi_{MN}\Psi^{MN}\big)^2 \nonumber\\
		&\quad +\eta_1 R_{MNPQ}\Psi^{MP}\Psi^{NQ}
		+\eta_2 \Psi_{MN}\Psi^{NP}\Psi_{PQ}\Psi^{QM}
		+\hbar^2(\nabla_M\delta\Psi_{NP})(\nabla^M\delta\Psi^{NP})
		+m_{\Psi}^2\delta\Psi_{MN}\delta\Psi^{MN}.
	\end{align}
	
	\paragraph{Generic sector-field block $L_s$ (for sector $s$).}
	A sector block can be expressed as:
	\begin{align}
		L_s &= L^{(\mathrm{carrier})}_s + L^{(\mathrm{kin})}_s + L^{(\mathrm{pot})}_s + L^{(\mathrm{coord})}_s, \\
		L^{(\mathrm{kin})}_s &:= \frac{1}{2}g^{MN}\partial_M\Phi_s\,\partial_N\Phi_s^\dagger, \\
		L^{(\mathrm{pot})}_s &:= -V_s(\Phi_s), \\
		L^{(\mathrm{coord})}_s &:= \alpha_s K_{\mathrm{eff},s}\,(\nabla_M\Psi_{sN})(\nabla^M\Psi_{s}{}^{N}) + \cdots,
	\end{align}
	where the ellipsis denotes additional sector-specific couplings and constraints.
	
	\paragraph{Observer fields $L_{\phi}$.}
	A minimal coupling block is:
	\begin{equation}
		L_{\phi}=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\Big(\partial_M\phi_i\partial^M\phi_i - m_{\phi_i}^2\phi_i^2\Big) + \lambda_{\phi}\phi_1^2\phi_2^2 + g_{\phi\Psi}\phi_1\phi_2\Psi_{MN}\Psi^{MN}.
	\end{equation}
	
	\paragraph{Language fields $L_{\mathrm{lang}}$ (effective module).}
	\begin{align}
		L_{\mathrm{lang}} &= \sum_{\alpha=1}^{N_{\mathrm{lang}}}\Big[
		\frac{1}{2}\nabla_M\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}^{(\alpha)}\nabla^M\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}^{(\alpha)}
		- V_{\mathrm{lang}}\big(\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}^{(\alpha)}\big)
		+ \lambda_{\alpha\beta}\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}^{(\alpha)}\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}^{(\beta)}
		\Big] \nonumber\\
		&\quad + \kappa_{\mathrm{grammar}}\epsilon^{MNOP}\nabla_M\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}\nabla_N\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}\nabla_O\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}\nabla_P\Phi_{\mathrm{lang}}.
	\end{align}
	
	\paragraph{YPSDC term $L_{\mathrm{YPSDC}}$ (protocol-encoding module).}
	A representative structure is:
	\begin{equation}
		L_{\mathrm{YPSDC}} = \sum_{i,j}\kappa_{ij}\,\delta^{(19)}(X-X_{\mathrm{obs}})\,\phi_i(X)\phi_j(X')\,
		\exp\!\Big(\int d\tau\,\Psi_{MN}\dot X^M\dot X^N\Big)\,
		\prod_{\mathrm{codes}}\delta\big(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{prior}}(\kappa)-A\big),
	\end{equation}
	to be interpreted as an effective constraint-activation term linking observer anchors, coordination geometry, and dictionary-based activation.
	
	\subsection*{A.L.3. How to use the Lagrangian operationally}
	Operational usage is modular:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
		\item \textbf{Populate sectors:} implement sector models $\Phi_s$ with validated equations and observables.
		\item \textbf{Define constraint sets:} for each sector $r$, define auditable constraints $P_r$ for cross-sector checks.
		\item \textbf{Initialize couplings:} load baseline $\kappa_{sr}$ from prior calibration or priors.
		\item \textbf{Run event inference:} map event $\to$ primary sector $s$ and initial conditions.
		\item \textbf{Activate couplings:} propagate effects along top-$k$ links by $|\kappa_{sr}|$ (or $|\kappa_{sr}|q_r$).
		\item \textbf{Produce predictions:} emit sector-wise predicted observables with uncertainty and time windows.
		\item \textbf{Verify and update:} evaluate against data; update $\kappa$ and possibly sector models.

	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{A.11. Testability and System-Level Verification (Extended)}
	\label{sec:extended-testability}
	
	\subsection*{A.11.1. Why system-level verification is necessary}
	Testing all 7140 intersector couplings $\kappa_{sr}$ in isolation is generally infeasible. YUCT therefore adopts a system-level verification strategy in which the model is evaluated by reproducible predictive performance on complex events and by cross-sector constraint satisfaction.
	
	\subsection*{A.11.2. Evaluation objects: events, outcomes, and constraints}
	Each evaluation instance is defined by:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item an event specification $E$ (primary sector assignment, initial conditions, time window),
		\item an outcome vector $Y(E)$ containing sector-wise observables,
		\item constraint sets $P_r$ used for cross-sector consistency checks (as defined in A.FD),
		\item a declared baseline comparator model (non-YUCT or reduced YUCT).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{A.11.3. Metrics}
	We recommend reporting:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item \textbf{Predictive accuracy:} sector-wise RMSE/MAE for continuous targets; F1/AUC for discrete outcomes.
		\item \textbf{Calibration:} reliability diagrams; proper scoring rules (Brier score / log score).
		\item \textbf{Cross-sector consistency:} average constraint satisfaction rate across relevant $P_r$ sets.
		\item \textbf{Ablation tests:} performance change when specific $\kappa$ subnetworks are removed.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{A.11.4. Benchmark protocol (retrospective corpora)}
	Construct a benchmark dataset of $N$ historical events, split into train/validation/test:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
		\item fit $\kappa$ (and optional sector authority weights $q_r$) on train,
		\item tune hyperparameters on validation (regularization, sparsity, priors),
		\item report final metrics on held-out test.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection*{A.11.5. Progress metrics and an A/B study on research programs}
	Define program-level progress metrics:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item \textbf{Time-to-correction (TTC):} median time from publication to validated correction after falsifying evidence appears.
		\item \textbf{Retraction rate (RR):} retractions per $N$ publications, stratified by field.
		\item \textbf{Replication success (RS):} fraction of attempted replications meeting pre-registered success criteria.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{A/B experimental design.}
	Compare two matched research programs:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item Program A: YUCT-screened (cross-sector constraints + false-dictionary scoring).
		\item Program B: baseline practice (standard peer review without YUCT scoring).
	\end{itemize}
	Primary hypotheses:
	$$
	\mathrm{TTC}_A < \mathrm{TTC}_B,\qquad \mathrm{RS}_A > \mathrm{RS}_B,
	$$
	subject to safeguards against novelty suppression (uncertainty reporting, provisional acceptance with explicit tests, and constraint-citation requirements for rejection).

	\paragraph{Scope note (scientific framing).}
	The examples below are included as \emph{method demonstrations}. Retrospective cases illustrate how to encode a historical event in sector variables and evaluate predicted quantities against historical data. Scenario cases illustrate how one would compute cross-sector stress indices and conditional forecasts under stated assumptions. These sections are not policy advice.

	\subsection*{A.12.1. Retrospective case study: Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945)}
	\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A.12.1. Retrospective case study: Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945)}
	
	We represent the atomic bombing as a localized perturbation activated across multiple sectors. A schematic source term for the primary perturbation can be written as:
	$$
	\Phi_{0}^{(\mathrm{bomb})}(t,\vec{x}) = E_0\,\delta^{(3)}(\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0)\,\big[\Theta(t-t_0)-\Theta(t-(t_0+\Delta t))\big],
	$$
	with $E_0\sim 10^{14}\ \mathrm{J}$ and $\Delta t\sim 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{s}$ (illustrative). Electromagnetic/radiative relaxation is represented by
	$$
	\Psi_{1,\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{EM}}(t)=F_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{rad}}\exp\!\left(-\frac{t-t_0}{\tau_{\mathrm{EM}}}\right),\qquad \tau_{\mathrm{EM}}\sim 1\ \mathrm{s}.
	$$
	
	Cross-sector consequence channels are then organized as:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item \textbf{Survival/health shock} via a survival-like term (cf.\ $L_{\mathrm{survival}}$) that decreases local coordination capacity.
		\item \textbf{Ethical/social field perturbations} (modeled modules) that affect longer-time institutional response.
		\item \textbf{Global coordination recovery} modeled as a relaxation to a new coordination equilibrium.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{Example predicted quantities (from the provided technical note).}
	A representative response-time proxy is modeled as a phase-transition-like time-to-decision:
	$$
	\tau_{\mathrm{response}}^{\mathrm{pred}}\approx 9\text{--}10\ \mathrm{days},
	$$
	to be compared to historical decision timelines. A further predicted quantity is the time-to-first external nuclear test in an arms-race proxy model:
	$$
	t_{\mathrm{first\ test}}^{\mathrm{pred}} \approx t_0 + 4.5\ \mathrm{years}.
	$$
	These quantities are included here as demonstrations of how sector coupling and global coordination variables can be mapped to measurable historical outputs. Any claim of ``fit'' requires explicit parameter provenance, uncertainty budgets, and robustness tests.

	\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A.12.2. Retrospective case study: Chernobyl accident (1986)}
	
	In the provided technical note, the Chernobyl accident is represented as a prolonged source term in an energy-related sector with a nuclear-process component:
	$$
	Q_{1}^{\mathrm{Cs137}}(t,\vec{x}) = Q_0\,\Theta(t-t_0)\,\exp\!\left(-\frac{t-t_0}{\tau_{\mathrm{release}}}\right)\,G(\vec{x};\sigma),
	$$
	with $\tau_{\mathrm{release}}\sim 10\ \mathrm{days}$ and $G$ a spatial dispersion kernel (illustrative).
	
	A transport equation for radionuclide concentration is expressed (schematically) as:
	$$
	\frac{\partial C_{137}(\vec{x},t)}{\partial t}
	= \nabla\cdot\big(D\,\nabla C_{137}\big) - \vec{v}_{\mathrm{wind}}(t)\cdot\nabla C_{137} - \lambda_{\mathrm{phys}} C_{137}.
	$$
	The cross-sector channels include:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item radiation $\to$ biology (dose and internal uptake proxies),
		\item infrastructure shock $\to$ social/political dynamics (coordination degradation),
		\item global energy policy shift (long-memory response).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{Example quantitative targets (illustrative).}
	The note reports order-of-magnitude targets such as an exclusion-zone area scale and the time-to-system collapse proxy; these are included here as worked-example templates. A rigorous implementation must declare: datasets used, parameter priors, sensitivity analysis, and held-out evaluation.

	The provided note models pandemic emergence as crossing critical thresholds in ecology/biogeography, networks/trade, and healthcare resilience. A representative spillover pressure is written as:
	$$
	P_{\mathrm{spillover}} \propto \int_{t_0}^{t_{2019}}
	\left(\frac{dA_{\mathrm{interface}}}{dt}\right)\,
	\left(\rho_{\mathrm{host}}\rho_{\mathrm{human}}\right)\,
	\Psi_{63,66}(t)\,dt.
	$$
	A global spread proxy uses network connectivity and an operational travel coordination factor:
	$$
	R_0^{\mathrm{global}} = R_0^{\mathrm{local}}\left(1+\alpha\cdot \frac{\langle k\rangle_{\mathrm{air}}}{N_{\mathrm{cities}}}\cdot K_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{travel}}\right).
	$$
	For the outbreak phase, the note uses an SIR-type model modulated by coordination effectiveness of interventions:
	$$
	\frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta(t)}{K_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{NPIs}}(t)}SI,\qquad
	\frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta(t)}{K_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{NPIs}}(t)}SI - \gamma I.
	$$
	These equations are included here as templates for cross-sector encoding and for defining testable targets in the same formalism.

	\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A.12.4. Scenario demonstration: global stress index and conditional forecasts (2026--2035)}
	
	The provided ``global crises'' note defines a global stress index of the form
	$$
	\Pi_{\mathrm{global}}(t) = \sum_i w_i\,S_i(t)\,K_{\mathrm{eff},i}(t),
	$$
	where $S_i(t)$ are sector stress indicators and $K_{\mathrm{eff},i}(t)$ are coordination efficiency proxies for the corresponding sectoral subsystems. This is a scenario-oriented construction: outcomes depend on how $S_i$ and $K_{\mathrm{eff},i}$ are operationalized and measured.
	
	\paragraph{Scientific use.}
	The correct scientific use of such a scenario module is:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
		\item declare the data sources for each $S_i(t)$ and $K_{\mathrm{eff},i}(t)$,
		\item estimate $w_i$ by retrospective fitting with held-out validation,
		\item produce probabilistic forecasts with uncertainty and update rules,
		\item evaluate out-of-sample over rolling windows.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{Boundary conditions.}
	High-stakes geopolitical outcomes should be treated as scenarios, not as deterministic predictions. The formal value of this module is the explicit coupling structure and the possibility of falsification by forecast skill, not narrative detail.

	\paragraph{Scope note (strict scientific framing).}
	The examples below are included as \emph{method templates}. Retrospective cases illustrate how to encode a historical event in sector variables, define measurable outputs, and specify falsifiers. Scenario cases illustrate how to compute cross-sector stress indices and conditional forecasts under stated assumptions. These sections are not policy advice and make no statistical claims about predictive significance.

	\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A.12.1. Template: encoding a sudden shock event}
	
	A sudden shock can be represented as a localized source term activated across multiple sectors. A schematic source term can be written as:
	$$
	\Phi_{0}^{(\mathrm{shock})}(t,\vec{x}) = E_0\,\delta^{(3)}(\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0)\,\big[\Theta(t-t_0)-\Theta(t-(t_0+\Delta t))\big],
	$$
	with parameters $(E_0,t_0,\Delta t)$ specified from the event definition. A fast-relaxing electromagnetic/radiative channel may be represented (schematically) as:
	$$
	\Psi_{1,\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{EM}}(t)=F_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{rad}}\exp\!\left(-\frac{t-t_0}{\tau_{\mathrm{EM}}}\right),
	$$
	where $\tau_{\mathrm{EM}}$ is estimated from the dominant physical relaxation scale relevant to the chosen observable.
	
	\paragraph{Template outputs and falsifiers.}
	Select at least one measurable output per affected sector, e.g.:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item health burden proxy (sector 89): excess mortality, hospital load,
		\item governance decision proxy (sector 77): time-to-decision, policy activation index,
		\item technology response proxy (sector 96/100): adoption lag for a declared protocol.
	\end{itemize}
	Declare falsifiers as threshold conditions on out-of-sample data matching within a tolerance band and time window.

	$$
	Q(t,\vec{x}) = Q_0\,\Theta(t-t_0)\,\exp\!\left(-\frac{t-t_0}{\tau_{\mathrm{release}}}\right)\,G(\vec{x};\sigma),
	$$
	where $G$ is a dispersion kernel and $\tau_{\mathrm{release}}$ is estimated from event logs or physical modeling. A transport-like evolution can be specified by a PDE template:
	$$
	\frac{\partial C(\vec{x},t)}{\partial t}
	= \nabla\cdot\big(D\,\nabla C\big) - \vec{v}(t)\cdot\nabla C - \lambda C,
	$$
	with declared forcing and boundary conditions.
	
	\paragraph{Template outputs and falsifiers.}
	Define:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item contamination field outputs (sector 64/63): spatial integral above a threshold,
		\item health outputs (sector 89): incidence proxies over a defined horizon,
		\item governance/communication outputs (sectors 77/100): disclosure delay metrics.
	\end{itemize}
	Falsifiers require declared datasets, region definitions, and measurement uncertainty.

	\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A.12.4. Template: scenario-oriented global stress index}
	
	A scenario-oriented stress index can be defined as:
	$$
	\Pi_{\mathrm{global}}(t) = \sum_i w_i\,S_i(t)\,K_{\mathrm{eff},i}(t),
	$$
	where $S_i(t)$ are sector stress indicators and $K_{\mathrm{eff},i}(t)$ are declared coordination proxies for sectoral subsystems.
	
	\paragraph{Scientific use (constraints).}
	The scientific use of such a scenario module requires:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
		\item declared data sources for each $S_i(t)$ and $K_{\mathrm{eff},i}(t)$,
		\item weights $w_i$ fitted with cross-validation (not hand-picked),
		\item probabilistic forecasts with uncertainty,
		\item rolling out-of-sample evaluation vs baselines.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{Non-goals.}
	This template is not a substitute for domain-specific causal inference. Its value lies in making coupling assumptions explicit and in enabling falsification by forecast skill and constraint satisfaction.

	This appendix provides a practical technical guide for implementing YUCT V35.0 as an interdisciplinary prediction system: the key deliverables are the modular sector architecture, the explicit intersector coupling graph, reproducible verification protocols, and a false-dictionary diagnostic layer that supports scientific hygiene via cross-sector constraint satisfaction and testability requirements. The system is intended for empirical deployment under governance safeguards, with performance measured by reproducible prediction quality and by program-level progress metrics.
